# Google Drive Clone

![Screen Shot of Project](./screenshot.png)

Built based on this [tutorial - Full Stack Next.js, Typescript, Firebase Tutorial – Google Drive Clone](https://youtu.be/gwOVynGnDZA?feature=shared)

Changed quite a few things since the tutorial was honestly pretty hectic and unclear. It did give me some positive exposure with `next-auth` and forced me to read up on the Firebase docs (so that's a positive). There are a lot of features and issues that need to be added for it to offer anywhere near the level of convenience Google Drive offers. For now it was a great practice exercise using:

- Next.js
- Firebase
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
